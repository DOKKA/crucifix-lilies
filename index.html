					<h1>The reproduction process</h1>
					<p class="lead">The goal of reproducing a version of this masterpiece has taken over one year of intense labor and research.
						The original Crucifix was used to create the new molds of the Corpus and the Cross. Each new Crucifix with Lilies is directly touched by the original masterpiece.</p>

						One of the finest Silversmiths in the United States was selected to accomplish the enormous task. Raychel Wengenroth of Saugerites, New York at website <a href="http://www.raychelwengenroth.com">www.raychelwengenroth.com</a> heads up the development and production of this new version of the Crucifix with Lilies.

					<h1>History</h1>
					<p class="lead">In France, Symbolism in art is recognized as a dominant influence from 1880 to 1910. Symbolism influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style. This new art was inspired by natural forms and structures not only in flowers and plants, but also in curved lines with rhythmic floral patterns. In this regard, the original Crucifix with Lilies artist used significant deployments of symbolic numbers and patterns.</p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        There are twenty-two lilies on the Cross. This number is significant as there were twenty-two Books in the original Old Testament. There are seven lilies on each side of the hands of the Corpus of Jesus. The number "7" is considered by many experts to be God's very own number and is associated with Divine completion and perfection. There are eight lilies above the head of the Corpus of Jesus. The number "8" is the number specially assigned with the Resurrection and Regeneration and is the beginning of a new era or order. There are a total of seven leaves on the cross. The two stems of the lilies connect and join underneath the Corpus of Jesus to form the unity of The Father, Son and Holy Ghost completing the Holy Trinity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        The lily and the Crucifixion have a long history in the Christian faith. The use of lilies during the Easter Season in churches throughout the world continues in our time. The lily is known as the Easter Cross symbolizing the Resurrection of Christ. Since the Middle Ages, many paintings of Jesus include lilies to symbolize Jesus' suffering and triumph over death.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        In the Roman Catholic faith, Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903) was the first Pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as Mediatrix (The Virgin Mary as a mediator in the salvific redemption by her son, Jesus Christ). The artist of the original Crucifix with Lilies may have been influenced by the decrees of Pope Leo XIII. The lily has been recognized as a symbol of the Blessed Virgin Mary's purity having been chosen by the Trinity to be the Mother of God. The three petals of the lily represent the Holy Trinity, symbolizing the Mystery of one God in three Divine Persons.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        A close examination of the Crucifix with Lilies reveals a strong likeness to the facial image on the Shroud of Turin. The first photographic negative images of the Shroud was taken in 1898 by Secondo Pia. In 1902, Yves Delage, a French professor of Comparative Anatomy, lectured that the image was of Jesus Christ. By 1902, Paul Vignon published his book The Shroud of Christ. This new book contained a full explanation of the investigation into the Shroud. More importantly, his book contained clear photographic images of Jesus' face. His book was widely distributed in Paris. The impact on the religious artist of France was profound and this helps us date the creation of the Crucifix with Lilies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        On the occasion of the 100th year of Secundo Pia's (May 28, 1898) first photograph of the Shroud of Turin, on Sunday, May 24, 1998, Pope John Paul II visited the Turin Cathedral. During his address he said: "the Shroud is an image of God's love as well as of human sin"
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        During his message to the International Institute of Research on the Face of Christ in October of 2002, Pope John Paul II referred to his Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte which proclaims: "And is it not the Church's task to reflect the light of Christ in every historical period, to make his face shine also before generations of the new millennium? Our witness, however, would be hopelessly inadequate if we ourselves had not first contemplated his face."
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        When we view the Crucifix with Lilies, we understand that Jesus is already in transition. The head of Jesus Christ is not bowed downward in defeat and death, but is raised in triumph. In the Gospel of John, "one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water." The new and the original Crucifix with Lilies are both witnesses to the "King of the Jews" becoming the "King of Kings". The plaque above Jesus' head is gone - A New Beginning.
